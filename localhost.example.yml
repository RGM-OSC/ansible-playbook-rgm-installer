## You can however manually specify a new disk or unused partition afterwards.

## YOU'LL HAVE TO HANDLE THIS BY YOUR OWN !

## RGM can (or have to) require the installation of some software packages from third-party providers
## that are unfortunately distributed with a commercial license. So they are *not* installed by default
## by RGM.
## If you wish to install them anyway, you have explicitly allow RGM to install them by enabling the following variables.
## Please note that the activation of these implicitly means you accept the respective licenses !
#install_commercial_vmware:" true
#install_commercial_oracle:" true
